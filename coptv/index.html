          In 2021, SYFF trained and deployed 11 young people at the COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow. They produced a
          series of short films in the lead up to and during COP and every day from Monday 8th to Friday 12th November
          they live-streamed an hour long magazine style show with studio guests and curated content.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can see their programmes and some of the short films here - <a target="_blank"

              Hiya! My name is Becky and I live in Edinburgh (Although I’m originally from South Lanarkshire). I study Government Policy and Society with Quantitative Methods at the University of Edinburgh and have a strong interest in economic, environmental, educational and health policy. A fun fact about me is that I work as a roller skating instructor.
            </p>
            <p>
              With COP TV, I hope to be able to spread awareness of climate change both within my generation and beyond. As well as this I hope to be able to interview key environmental stakeholders and ask the difficult questions that young people need to know.

              My name is Zoë Conroy and I come from a village called Banchory. I am 17 years old and I am currently in my sixth year at Banchory Academy. I have secured a place at Edinburgh Napier for a 4 year long photography course starting in 2022. I really hope to go into the fashion industry as I have always felt that change is necessary from within.

            <p>
              I hope that COP TV will give me the opportunity to get myself and the other young people who are part of the team out there and our voices heard, so that the change is made.

              One day I want to be a  film/TV director so I am interested in directing, screenwriting and camera Work. It's been fun working with COP TV so far because it's given me the chance to meet like-minded people who have positive ideas around climate change.

            <p>
              I hope to influence the way young people think about climate change and I want more people to do their part in making the world a better place.

              Hi, I’m Scarlett from Ayr and I’m 16 years old.  I’m into lots of different fashion and music and I’ve been taking an interest lately not just in media and climate but how media can be more climate and carbon conscious. Totally fascinated by the technology of broadcasting and I hope to get a real chance through COP TV to gain experience in camera work and editing. Currently making my own personal film for COP TV about waterways near my home town.

              I recently had a chance to sit in on the editing of a documentary about Johnny Cash and his performance in San Quentin jail.

              My hope is, that through the COP TV project, I will be able to build upon my current understanding of both the climate crisis and the media industry. Going into this project, my experience was mainly media based – having made a few short films in the past, along with an interest in photography. Already I have learned vital skills in filmmaking, more about what we can do to tackle the climate crisis and the importance of COP26, something that will hopefully continue throughout the COP TV project.
