            I’m President because I believe Scotland badly needs to serve the

          <h2>Jason Connery</h2>
          <p>
            Jason Connery has appeared in over 80 films, television movies and
            series, combined, since his breakthrough role as "Robin Hood" in
            the UK television series Robin of Sherwood in 1985.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has since had starring roles in many feature films including
            Return of the Thief of Baghdad, Bullet to Beijing, Macbeth, Urban
            Ghost Story, Shanghai Noon, Wishmaster 3 The Gates of Hell, and
            Night skies. He has also starred in Television Movies, Merlin,
            Spymaker The Secret Life of Ian Fleming, Lightspeed, Mountain of
            Diamonds, and many series, Smallville, Liberty’s Kids, and Shoebox

          <p>
            In 2015 he shot Tommy’s Honour in Scotland and opened the
            Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2016 and won the Scottish

            up and running with his business partner Bob Last.

          <h3>I’m a Patron Because…</h3>
          <p>
            I feel that there is far too much emphasis put on how much or who
            has the right to tell stories on film. If I can help young Scots,
            in any way extinguish that belief and promote the idea that anyone
            can tell their stories and it doesn’t have anything to do with
            money or right. It has to do with having fun, expressing
            themselves, telling their stories and not being hogtied by social
            constraints. That is why I am a SYFF Patron.

          <h2>Jack Lowden</h2>
          <p>
            Jack Lowden is a graduate of the Scottish Royal Academy of Music and Drama.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jack is currently starring in Apple TV's Slow Horses and will soon be seen as the lead in the BBC and
            Paramount+ drama series <em>The Gold</em>, directed by recent Oscar winner Aneil Karia (The Long Goodbye).
            Also on
            the horizon is <em>The Outrun</em>, which Jack has produced under his production banner, <em>Arcade
              Pictures</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Previous films include <em>Benediction</em>, for which Jack won his second Scottish BAFTA, <em>Dunkirk</em>,
            <em>Calibre</em>, <em>Mary
              Queen of Scots</em>, <em>Fighting with my Family</em> and <em>Tommy's Honour</em> (directed by fellow SYFF
            patron, Jason Connery).
          </p>
          <p>TV dramas include the aforementioned <em>Slow Horses</em>, <em>Small Axe</em> and <em>War and Peace</em>.
          </p>
          <p>Jack’s breakthrough was in The National Theatre of Scotland’s production of <em>Black Watch</em>.</p>

          <h3>I’m a Patron Because…</h3>
          <p>
            Although I owe everything to stage, and the fantastic opportunities that were all around me growing up to be
            in amateur plays and youth theatre, that wasn't the same when it came to film. And that's where the majority
            of the work is now. So having something fantastic like SYFF available for young folk to get to grips with a
            film set early on is invaluable and something I wish I'd had.

          <p>
            Hiftu Quasem is a Scottish actress best known for her role as Misha in <em>Ten Percent (Amazon Prime
              Video)</em>.
          </p>

            Hiftu has also appeared in the BBC’s award-winning series <em>Killing Eve, The Witcher (Netflix), This is
              Going to Hurt (BBC), The Nest (BBC), Traces (BBC), and Endeavour (ITV)</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            She began her acting career in a range of short films such as <em>Tehzeeb</em> and <em>Meet Me By The
              Water</em> (written and directed by SYFF board member Raisah Ahmed). Theatre credits include: <em>Miss
              Julie (Perth, Tron, and Edinburgh Festival Theatre)</em> and <em>At Home I Speak (Rich Mix Theatre)</em>.
          </p>
          <h3>I’m a Patron Because…</h3>
          <p>
            I believe the arts industry should be more accessible to young people from underrepresented communities.
            SYFF encourages young Scots to enjoy being creative, explore filmmaking with confidence and help boost the
            next generation of talent.

            Allowing young people to share their creativity and work towards a
            shared project is so important. The confidence it brings is
            priceless, by broadening their knowledge of film making, the
            industry and learning new skills.

          <h3>I’m a Patron Because…</h3>
          <p>
            I am an SYFF patron because I believe they provide truly unique
            and invaluable opportunities. I never had the chance to experience
            camera work before being on a job and there is so much to learn.
            SYFF allows young people the opportunity to explore the complex
            filming process at a grassroots level. They provide a place of
            safety to get creative, experiment, have fun and make friends.
            SYFF have the power to inspire and instil confidence in Scotland’s
            future film-makers.
