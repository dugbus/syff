          <h2>Jason Connery</h2>
          <p>
            Jason Connery has appeared in over 80 films, television movies and
            series, combined, since his breakthrough role as "Robin Hood" in
            the UK television series Robin of Sherwood in 1985.
          </p>
          <p>
            He has since had starring roles in many feature films including
            Return of the Thief of Baghdad, Bullet to Beijing, Macbeth, Urban
            Ghost Story, Shanghai Noon, Wishmaster 3 The Gates of Hell, and
            Night skies. He has also starred in Television Movies, Merlin,
            Spymaker The Secret Life of Ian Fleming, Lightspeed, Mountain of
            Diamonds, and many series, Smallville, Liberty’s Kids, and Shoebox

          <h3>I’m a Patron Because…</h3>
          <p>
            I feel that there is far too much emphasis put on how much or who
            has the right to tell stories on film. If I can help young Scots,
            in any way extinguish that belief and promote the idea that anyone
            can tell their stories and it doesn’t have anything to do with
            money or right. It has to do with having fun, expressing
            themselves, telling their stories and not being hogtied by social
            constraints. That is why I am a SYFF Patron.

          <p>
            I got my start in youth theatre and think it’s such a brilliant
            and important thing to do in your adolescence. Both to further
            your aspirations and to make similarly minded friends. I’m so
            happy and excited to be joining SYFF as a patron.

            Allowing young people to share their creativity and work towards a
            shared project is so important. The confidence it brings is
            priceless, by broadening their knowledge of film making, the
            industry and learning new skills.

          <h3>I’m a Patron Because…</h3>
          <p>
            I am an SYFF patron because I believe they provide truly unique
            and invaluable opportunities. I never had the chance to experience
            camera work before being on a job and there is so much to learn.
            SYFF allows young people the opportunity to explore the complex
            filming process at a grassroots level. They provide a place of
            safety to get creative, experiment, have fun and make friends.
            SYFF have the power to inspire and instil confidence in Scotland’s
            future film-makers.
